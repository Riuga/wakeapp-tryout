                We create a variety of games designed to entertain everyone in
                the room via Zoom calls or Twitch streams. Designing games,
                writing games, mini-games, stealth games... no partygoer is left
                behind.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every year since 2014 we release a new collection of games
                packaged as the Jackbox Party Pack. In each package you will
                find 5 different games that can accommodate 1-8 players. If you
                have a lot of people in your group, then we're happy to be
                popular and most of our games get the crowd playing, meaning
                they can keep jumping and having fun!
              </p>
              <p>
                We also have special horror games like <i>Aboba</i> that are
                available outside of party packs.

                You purchased a package. You've gathered your team. All you need
                is to start the game and play! Here we have helpful video
                tutorials and step-by-step instructions on how to get all your
                players hooked into the game. This page also includes
                information on how to access additional channels and options for
                each game.

                The important thing is to ensure that everyone in your party (in
                person or remotely) can see and hear the game screen. This will
                allow them to access room codes, work together, see what's going
                on in the game, and play together.

                We have a great support site with lots of troubleshooting tips
                and tricks here. You can also donate a ticket to our support
                team. They try to respond within 1-3 business hours. Holidays
                may take a little longer if we're affected.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, our strong recommendation is that if a player's mobile
                device disconnects during gameplay... they should try updating
                their browser. Most of the time they meet right away. If not,
                please let us know. As we say: no partygoer is left behind.
